    We want to use CloudFormation to modify a CloudFront Distribution 
    later on. It will be MUCH easier to do this if CloudFormation was 
    responsible for creating the distribution in the first place, 
    thus creating a "stack" that can be easily accessed.
    This file to your repo as you will need it in the automation 
    steps late.
